## Udemy Data Scrapper


#### I created this program to help me extract all name of classes from udemy's course.

I take udemy courses everyday and I'ts hard to keep in track of my courses, so I make github repositories about them...

Since I share my udemy courses with friends and they share with me (sorry udemy), I created this piece of code to extract all name of the udemy's tutorials so I can use it in my personal documentation to track my courses.

With this code I can extract the name and info of all classes I'm gonna go through in my course so I can create a github repository for them
